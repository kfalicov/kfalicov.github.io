            <p>Have you ever wondered what the denizens of a realm think about a hero who exploits them for their own gain?
            <br>A hero who just walks into every unlocked house and takes what they please?
            <br>What about a hero who tramples plants and break pots on the off-chance they find something valuable?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                You start your quest as a simple peasant who follows in the aftermath of the journey of one such "hero". Along your travels, you will encounter many situations which will challenge the very idea of what it means to be "good". Will you right the wrongs of the hero who came before you, or will you follow in their footsteps? The decision lies with you!

                Features:
                <br>An infinite, procedurally-generated overworld,
                with generated villages and dungeons.
                <br>NPC interactions have significant impact on future events and encounters.
                <br>A unique combat system that transitions between real-time overworld movement and turn-based combat, without the need for a 'battle menu.'
                <br>Simple control scheme for equipping items. No complex inventory managing!
                <br>A health system that prioritizes maintaining armor integrity.
                <br><br>...And much more that's secret for now!
